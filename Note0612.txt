print("Hello world!")

What is a computer? definition

1.Arithmetic  1+1=2
2.Logic 

Turing-Complete 
Turing Machine

Using a machine as its full capacity???



Function

in -----function----- out 
(text)                (writes in terminal)

  .py > translator > console > screen 

black boxes 
With Library, you don't need to understand(not necessory), you can use it! (extend...customize)


Data type

"Hello world!" data type: string 
4:integer
4.7: float, double

Hello world!??? you have to tell this is string!! it's about Syntax


Script vs Console

Script
Code in a file 

Console 
interface human and computer

Interpreter
(To open this, just type python in the console... to exit, type exit(), once it open you could see >>>)
or without saving code in the file, you can just input the code directly to interpreter!

Python

readable languge cause you can easily understand the other's code.
but very slow...


Java Script

functional programming 

x="Hello World" 
print(x)

in order to memorize, what the computer print..

Variable 	        	Value
----------------------------------------------
x 	        	      	"Hello World" 
y				3
name				3.7
				[3,4,10]

letter without "" 		True, False



"" vs ''
'Simon says, "Jump!"'

Operation 

2+2 
+ is opertator
x=4, = is assignment operator

arithmetic 

+ addition 
- substraction
* mutiplication
/ divition
% modulus

you could add strings


logic

2==2 True
2==3 False
>=
<=
>
<
!=

Assignment
=
+=	equal to 
x=x+3   equal to x+=3 ( take x, add 3 and save to x)
-=
/=
*=



Recommand to study, nand2tetris!

Exercise
x=10324

calculate 
x+x
x-257
x*x
x%37
and print answers 
to cosole



Convert Second to Hour:minutes??
